# Automation exercise

The idea of this project is to allow us to evaluate how you organize your work, write and document code and approach the testing of a specific app.

The source code is a simple Calculator for Android which included and the UI elements already have the accessibility labels set.

After reviewing how the app works, document a set of test cases that cover the Division and Subtraction operations.

Once you have defined the test cases, use Appium or Espresso with the programming language of your choice to automate them (preferably Java).

Finally, send your tests definition, scripts and full instructions to run them.
Also include assumptions you made, if any, during the process.
